[passed away]\\n- Before retirement, he primarily ____ in Oman.

[lived (Oman); lived (Norway)]\\n- Test B (terminal check): born → lived → retired → lived → _____.  [passed away]\\n\\n4) Context anchoring (temporal cues over places)\\n- Pre-retirement cue: lived (adult life) → Oman.\\n- Post-retirement cue: lived → Norway.\\n- Terminal cue: after retirement → passed away.\\n- Anchor “passed away” to “after retirement,” not to a place.\\n\\n5) Mixed review (make “passed away” pop as terminal)\\n- Identify the terminal event: retired / lived in Norway / passed away → Answer: passed away.\\n- Pick all post-retirement events: lived in Norway; passed away → Answer: both.\\n- Order scramble practice: retired → passed away → born → lived (Oman) → lived (Norway). Sort to: born → lived (Oman) → retired → lived (Norway) → passed away.\\n\\n6) Self-explanation (say aloud, briefly)\\n- He was born first, then spent his adult life living in Oman.

       " 'Here’s your sequence (India → Oman → Norway) learned with the given strategy.\\n\\n1) Chain-link story\\n- Ryan is born under a shower of marigolds by the Taj Mahal in India. A cradle shaped like a spice boat sails across the Arabian Sea, spilling cardamom and cumin right into Muscat’s souk in Oman, where Ryan grows up, dons a suit, and works among frankincense stalls and desert heat. When a golden retirement clock chimes, it transforms into a small Viking ship that carries him north to a Norwegian fjord, where he rocks in a chair under the aurora and peacefully passes away.\\n\\n2) Numbered pegs\\n- 1 (birth): Crib = India. Picture a baby in a crib with a tiny Taj Mahal mobile.\\n- 2 (adult life): Briefcase = Oman. Open it to smell frankincense and feel desert heat.\\n- 3 (post-retirement): Rocking chair = Norway. The chair sits by a cold blue fjord under green lights.\\n\\n3) Bidirectional practice\\n- Forward: India → Oman → Norway.\\n- Backward: Norway → Oman → India.\\n- Before/After prompts:\\n  - What comes before Oman? India.\\n  - What comes after Oman? Norway.\\n  - What comes before Norway? Oman.\\n  - What comes after India? Oman.\\n\\n4) Scramble test\\n- Write three slips: India, Oman, Norway. Shuffle; reorder to the correct sequence. Aim to do it correctly in under 10 seconds. Repeat 3–5 rounds.\\n- Quick digital scramble example: Norway, India, Oman → reorder to India, Oman, Norway.\\n\\n5) Compression\\n- One-breath summary: “India → Oman → Norway.”\\n- Bonus compression: ION (India–Oman–Norway), like a charged particle. Whisper “ION” while visualizing Taj → Souk → Fjord.\\n- Say the one-breath line five times spaced across the day (morning, mid-morning, afternoon, evening, bedtime).\\n\\n6) Error trap review\\n- Deliberately wrong: “India → Norway → Oman” (swap the last two).\\n- Correct it aloud: “No—heat before cold: India → Oman → Norway.”\\n- Guard rails:\\n  - Heat (Oman) before Cold (Norway).\\n  - Work briefcase before rocking chair.\\n  - Souk before Fjord.\\n\\nQuick self-checks (answer instantly):\\n- Birth?
